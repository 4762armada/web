                . Except as provided in Section lO(d) above, the arbitrator
                shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any
                claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or
                injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
                relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
                warranted by that party&#39;s individual claim. To the extent
                that you or punk4762 prevail on a claim and seek public
                injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the
                primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
                threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and
                extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of
                competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
                that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall
                be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual
                claims in arbitration.
